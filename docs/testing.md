# Testing Strategy and Coverage Goals

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Chatear backend, focusing on unit tests for core components.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are written using Go's built-in `testing` package. They are placed in the same directory as the code they test, with filenames ending in `_test.go`.

### Components Covered by Unit Tests:

*   **Usecases (Business Logic):** Tests ensure that the application's business rules and logic are correctly implemented and behave as expected under various conditions. This includes testing input validation, interaction with repositories, and correct output generation.
*   **Token Utilities:** Tests verify the correct generation, parsing, validation, and expiration of authentication tokens.
*   **Repositories:** Tests ensure that data access logic correctly interacts with databases (PostgreSQL) and caching layers (Redis). These tests will typically use mock implementations of the database and Redis clients to isolate the repository logic from actual external dependencies.

### Mocking Strategy

For repository tests, mock implementations of database connections and Redis clients will be used to:
*   Isolate the code under test.
*   Ensure tests are fast and deterministic.
*   Avoid reliance on external services during testing.

## Integration/End-to-End Testing

Currently, comprehensive integration and end-to-end tests are not implemented. Stubs for these tests may be present but are not actively maintained or run as part of the standard test suite. Future work will involve developing a robust integration testing strategy.

## Coverage Goals

The primary goal for unit test coverage is to achieve a high percentage (e.g., >80%) for usecase, token utility, and repository packages. This ensures that the critical business logic and data access layers are thoroughly vetted. Code coverage will be monitored to identify areas lacking sufficient test coverage.
